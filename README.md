## About the challenge
The challenge consists in creating a java library capable of read a text file that contains definitions of "Things" and "Packages".
Those things, that will be placed inside one package, are defined through 3 attributes, index, weight and cost, 
while the packages have only one attribute which is the maximum weight of things that it can support.

The library should then choose the things that should be placed inside the package respecting it's maximum weight and 
maximizing the total cost of the package.

## Release
There are two releases of this library one could chose:
- [Simple Release](http://github.com/hectorblanco83/PackageChallenge/releases/tag/v1.0): Use this jar if you will obtain this library's dependencies manually.
- [Full Release](http://github.com/hectorblanco83/PackageChallenge/releases/tag/v1.0-dependencies): This jar contains all dependencies already packed inside it, and you will need anything else to use it.
